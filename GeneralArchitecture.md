# General Architecture  

Our deeply felt conviction that we are creating a system that can both help the business and community to grow, and also to be able to grow with them. Our obsession is not any specific architecture, it's our customers and their goals. Accordingly, the goal is not to provide an architecture, but rather a solution for Kwaku, his customers, and his community. 
This is why our architecture is a hybrid, where every capability and subsystem is designed in such a way as to best serve both their specific task, and the overal purpose. 
It scales and grows together with the business it is built to support. 
Having said that, it seems that eventually our architecture natuturally evolved into a more of the event driven variety because of necessity to support more complex workflows over time, and the need to gather data for business analytics.

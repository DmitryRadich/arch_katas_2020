# The "Farmacy Food" System

## Prelude

All successful business stories start with a problem to solve, a pain to heal, an itch to scratch. In this case, we are talking about a very particular and personal pain. Kwaku, the person who originated the idea of "Farmacy Food", was frustrated and low, overwhelmed by a recent failure of his latest business venture. His energy level was low, his time was extremely limited, and his mind was preoccupied by anything but maintaining a healthy diet. It was then, when an idea, itching in the background of his mind - how do I get myself a healthy snack without worrying about its quality or wasting too much precious time on preparing it or looking for it - struck a business chord. Why, in fact, should ANYONE have to worry about getting a healthy meal, especially people with busy and hectic working schedule? People like Kwaku do worry about such things, and for a good reason. Modern entrepreneur is a high pressure business machine, and a well-functioning machine needs high quality fuel provided when necessary. We are what we eat. We function as we eat. It is especially important in these trying times, where COVID-19 wreaks havoc in the restaurants and food markets. Kwaku already has the dots - the kitchen, the fridges, the locations. Our goal as a team is to help him to connect them.

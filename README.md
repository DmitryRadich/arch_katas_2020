# The "Farmacy Food" System  

## Prelude  

All successful business stories start with a problem to solve. In this case, all began with a very personal pain. Kwaku, the person who originated the idea of "Farmacy Food", was frustrated, overwhelmed by a recent failure of his latest business venture. His energy level was low, his time was extremely limited, and his mind was preoccupied by anything but maintaining a healthy diet. It was then, when a thought of how to get a healthy snack without worrying about its quality or wasting too much precious time on preparing it or looking for it struck a business chord. Modern entrepreneur is a high pressure business machine, and a well-functioning machine needs high quality fuel provided when necessary. We are what we eat. We function as we eat. It is especially important in these trying times, where COVID-19 wreaks havoc in the restaurants and food markets. Kwaku already has the dots - the kitchen, the fridges, the locations. Our goal as a team is to help him to connect them, by creating a system that can grow, expand, thrive and benefit both the owners and the community as a whole.  

## The Vision  

We also understand that any system or business usually have humble beginnings and then grow organically into something more. The question is, into what. _Ab initio_, all __Farmacy Food__ has is a kitchen, the fridges, and a modest accounting and payment capabilities managed via QuickBooks.
Our vision is to build up from these capabilities and to evolve __Farmacy Food__ into a meeting place and even a social network, where health experts and customers can live the motto of business founder, Kwaku: _"Let thy food be thy medicine"_. There they would exchange and purchase recipes, meal plans and health related content, with the underlying infrastructure allowing them to purchase meals or subscribe whole meal plans from the experts of their choice, with a guarantee of delivery to the smart fridge near them.
Our conviction that we are not creating a mere mechanism, but a living community and therefore a system that can both help the business and community to grow, and also to be able to grow with them.
